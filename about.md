Most people know mathematics by mechanically applying formulas as they know visual art only by watching paitings, movies, video games or comics.
But as watching pictures does not make you an artist, applying formulas does not make you a mathematician.

Mathematics and Arts are more alike than they may look.
Perspective and color theory aside, I mean that the required mindset for both should be very creative.
In both you have to design original solutions for a so far unreached objective like a new story or an unproved theorem.

This blog is the place where I will explain my solutions for problems in those two fields and in some other related ones.
By no means this blog is intended to be a reference document.
